<p>Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an American children’s book series and media franchise created by author
     and cartoonist Jeff Kinney.<br> The series follows Greg Heffley,<br> a middle-schooler who illustrates his daily life in a diary (although he constantly tells the audience that it is a journal)

    <br>Kinney spent 8 years working on the book before showing it to a publisher.<br> In 2004, 
    FunBrain and Kinney released an online version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The website made daily entries from September 2004 to June 2005.<br> The online version had received almost 20 million views by 2009.<br> Nonetheless, many online readers requested a printed version. In February 2006, during the New York Comic Con,
    <br>  Kinney signed a multi-book deal with publisher Abrams Books to turn Diary of a
     Wimpy Kid into a printed book series.<br> The first installment was released in April 2007
      and received immediate success.<br> In April 2009,
       Time magazine named Kinney in the Time 100 most influential people.<br>
    Sixteen books in the series have been released as of 2021,<br> and a 17th book is due to be 
    released in October 2022 (Diper Överlöde);<br> an activity book has also been released. A spin-off series, centering on the character Rowley Jefferson,<br> has three installments as of 2021. The first, second, fourth and ninth installments have been adapted into films by 20th
     Century Fox;<br> two books have been released chronicling the production of the films.</p>
